**Text**:
Mathematical Statistics with Applications, 7th ed., D.D. Wackerly, W. Mehdenhall, R.L. Schaeffer, Duxbury Pacific Grove, 2002. 

We will cover material from the following chapters in the book: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

mation.


**Office**:
Office: LO 1303G
Office hours: Mon 1:30-2:30, Wed 1:30-2:30, and by appointment


**Grading**:
Your grade will depend on the three midterm exams, about 12 homework quizzes,
and the nal exam.
Each of the midterm exams is worth 35 points and the combined homework quiz scores are
worth 35 points. But only the best three of these four scores will count toward your grade.
For example, if your scores are 30 on Exam 1, 20 on Exam 2, 35 on Exam 3, and 25 (out
of 35) on the homework quizzes, then the 20 on Exam 2 doesn't count and you have a total
of 30 + 35 + 25 = 90 out of a possible 105 points. Another example: 28 on Exam 1, 30
on Exam 2, you are absent for Exam 3, 35 on the homework quizzes. Then your total is
28 + 30 + 35 = 93 out of 105 points. No makeup exams or quizzes.
The final exam counts 60 points, so the maximum number of points for the course is 165
and I will base your grade on this total score.


The exams will be given on the following dates:

**Exam 1**: Monday, September 23

**Exam 2**: Monday, October 28

**Exam 3**: Monday, November 25

Exams are given at the end of a class period. If you are absent on an exam day, then that
exam will be the one that does not count. No makeup exams. I use plus-minus grading.
The final is given on Wednesday, December 11 from 5:30 to 7:30. You must take the final at
this time.
